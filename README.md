<h4 align="center">What is it?</h4>

A minimal Android launcher consisting of an auto-completing application search+launch field... simmilar to a command shell.

<h4 align="center">Why?</h4>

It's faster.

Given that the goal of touchscreens has been to get **away** from keyboards, this may seem like a counter intuitive approach to the homescreen. Some new phones are being released with *physical keyboards* again (not much of a [growth market](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=physical%20keyboard) but blackberry seem pretty confident its [still a thing](https://www.blackberrymobile.com/uk/keyone/)). Physical keyboards allow the user a great opportunity for workflow enhancement, faster accessing of a great array of shortcuts. Typing two keys (`c-<RET>` for `chrome`, for example) can be a lot faster than opening up an app drawer, finding the desired app, and then pressing it. Chrome is maybe a bad example, most people have their web browser as a shortcut on their main homescreen. So this may be slower. 

What about the lesser used applications? What about Messenger? Sure, thats on there. Whatsapp too? What about SMS? That's a lot of messaging apps! What about Facebook? And Twitter? And Instagram? All on there? Jeez, that home screen is getting cluttered! This is where the power of the prompt comes in. From the prompt, a few key presses is all it takes to launch to get to your favourite apps!

<h4 align="center">Who is this for?</h4>

Me, mostly. Or someone who doesn't mess about with fancy app drawers and complicated gestures to get to their apps. Someone who wants to get things done with a minimum of fuss, but with a modicum of elegance and retro style. Of course, its also for the shell nerd. Do you feel uncomfortable away from a VT102? Not to fear, SHAUN is here!
